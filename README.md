DevOps Fundamentals

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that bridges development and operations teams to deliver software faster and more reliably. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring throughout the software development lifecycle.

Core Principles:

    Collaboration: Breaking down silos between development, operations, and other teams
    Automation: Automating repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning
    Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery: Frequent code integration and automated deployment pipelines
    Monitoring and Feedback: Real-time monitoring and quick feedback loops
    Infrastructure as Code: Managing infrastructure through code and version control

Git Version Control

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It's essential for collaboration and maintaining code history.

Key Concepts:

    Repository: A project's complete history and metadata
    Commit: A snapshot of changes with a unique identifier
    Branch: Parallel development lines (main, feature branches, hotfix branches)
    Merge: Combining changes from different branches
    Remote: Shared repositories (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

Common Workflow:

git clone → git branch → git add → git commit → git push → pull request → merge

IP Addressing

IP addressing provides unique identifiers for devices on networks, enabling communication across the internet and local networks.

IPv4 Structure:

    32-bit addresses written as four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
    Classes A, B, C for different network sizes
    Private ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
    Public addresses for internet communication

IPv6:

    128-bit addresses for expanded address space
    Written in hexadecimal with colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)

Subnetting

Subnetting divides large networks into smaller, manageable subnetworks for better organization, security, and performance.

CIDR Notation:

    192.168.1.0/24 means 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts
    /24 = 256 addresses (254 usable), /25 = 128 addresses (126 usable)

Benefits:

    Improved network performance and security
    Better IP address utilization
    Easier network management and troubleshooting

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)

CI/CD automates the software delivery process from code commit to production deployment.

Continuous Integration:

    Developers integrate code frequently (multiple times daily)
    Automated builds and tests run on each integration
    Quick feedback on code quality and functionality
    Prevents integration hell and reduces bugs

Continuous Delivery/Deployment:

    Automated deployment pipelines
    Code moves through environments (dev → test → staging → production)
    Automated testing at each stage
    Fast, reliable releases with rollback capabilities

Pipeline Stages:

    Code commit triggers pipeline
    Build and compile code
    Run automated tests (unit, integration, security)
    Deploy to staging environment
    Run acceptance tests
    Deploy to production (manual approval or automatic)

Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates CI/CD pipelines and DevOps workflows.

Key Features:

    Pipeline as Code: Define build pipelines in Jenkinsfile using Groovy syntax
    Plugin Ecosystem: 1,500+ plugins for integration with various tools
    Distributed Builds: Master-slave architecture for scalability
    Easy Installation: Available for multiple operating systems

Pipeline Types:

    Freestyle Projects: GUI-based configuration
    Pipeline Projects: Code-based pipeline definitions
    Multibranch Pipelines: Automatic pipeline creation for Git branches

Common Jenkins Pipeline Structure:
groovy

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') { /* build steps */ }
        stage('Test') { /* test steps */ }
        stage('Deploy') { /* deployment steps */ }
    }
}

Additional DevOps Tools and Concepts

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

    Terraform: Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
    Ansible: Configuration management and automation
    CloudFormation: AWS-specific infrastructure templates

Containerization:

    Docker: Application containerization platform
    Kubernetes: Container orchestration and management
    Docker Swarm: Docker's native orchestration tool

Monitoring and Observability:

    Prometheus: Metrics collection and alerting
    Grafana: Data visualization dashboards
    ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for log management
    APM tools: Application performance monitoring

Configuration Management:

    Ansible: Agentless automation platform
    Puppet: Configuration management with agents
    Chef: Infrastructure automation platform

Cloud Platforms:

    AWS: Amazon Web Services with extensive DevOps tools
    Azure DevOps: Microsoft's integrated DevOps platform
    Google Cloud Platform: GCP with Cloud Build and other tools

The DevOps landscape continues evolving with new tools and practices, but the core principles of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement remain constant. Success requires not just technical tools but also cultural transformation and team alignment around shared goals.
